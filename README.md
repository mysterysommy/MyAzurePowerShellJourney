# MyAzurePowerShellJourney
My personal learning journey of using PowerShell for Azure Administration.

My Objectives are:
- Get solid foundation and become very comfortable with the use of PowerShell
- Get familiar with the cmdlets
- Deploy and manage resources using PowerShell
- Automate tasks 
- Create scripts for future deployments

Your suggestions are always welcome.
